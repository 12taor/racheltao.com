Hello!

My name is Rachel (she/her), and I am a Healthcare Data Analyst at Fair Health. I received my BA in Environmental Biology from Columbia University in 2016, and returned to Columbia in 2019 for my MPH in Epidemiology, which I completed in May 2021. During the years in between, I worked for the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation assessing ecosystem services from green roofs, and was a research assistant in Pediatric Endocrinology at Columbia Medical Center for 2 years. My interests include public health solutions, environmental health, and science communication.

Recently, I have worked on projects about 1) air pollutant mixtures as health exposures and 2) COVID-19 vaccine equity and outreach. You can learn more about each of these projects [here](data/Rachel_Tao_Resume.pdf).

I also like: plants, free jazz, knitting, local government, fried rice, bike rides, and Yamiche Alcindor.
