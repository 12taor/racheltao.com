I am only as successful as the teams that I am working with, so here is a list of groups I am currently involved with, as well as organizations that have made an impact on me in the past:

[iCARE](https://imperialbrc.nihr.ac.uk/facilities/icare/) (Imperial Clinical Analytics, Research and Evaluation) is a team of researchers and data specialists at Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust who leverage routinely collected data in healthcare towards quality improvement in healthcare, health research, and public health.

[Fair Health](https://www.fairhealth.org/) is an independent nonprofit that manages the United States' largest database of privately billed health insurance claims. They create data products that represent the cost of healthcare in different parts of the United States. I work as part of the Product Review team, performing data analytics on our data products to ensure that we are presenting our data accurately and correctly.

[makLab](https://marianthi.github.io/makLAB.github.io/index.html) is an environmental epidemiology lab led by Dr. Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou at Columbia University, focusing on methodological issues in environmental health sciences. My master's thesis on air pollution and myocardial infarction has been driven by work in this lab and through collaboration with the members of this team.

[CSSC](https://www.vagelos.columbia.edu/education/student-resources/covid-19-student-service-corps-cssc) (COVID-19 Student Service Corps) is Columbia University students' answer to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students support health systems, patients, and communities through service learning. I co-led the effort to outreach members of the Washington Heights community for COVID-19 vaccinations at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Spring 2021.

[CIPHER](https://www.decipherpubhealth.org/) is a student-run organization at the Mailman School of Public Health dedicated to increasing accessibility and transparency of health information through collaboration with community partners in Washington Heights. We create online curricula for interested individuals, lead discussions with community-based organizations to identify relevant public health topics, and work directly with community members to address emerging needs from COVID-19.

The [Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism](https://www.pediatrics.columbia.edu/about-us/divisions/endocrinology-diabetes-and-metabolism) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center includes an all-star team of clinicians and physician-scientists whose work has been an inspiration to me as I begin my public health career. I worked as a research assistant, fellowship coordinator, and medical scribe there 2017-2019.

[CVTC](https://www.cvtcnyc.org/) supports survivors of sexual violence through psychological counseling, legal advocacy, and other services. I volunteered as an Emergency Department crisis counselor from 2016-2020, and mentored trainees for crisis counseling 2018-2020.

[Geenbelt Native Plant Center](https://www.nycgovparks.org/greening/greenbelt-native-plant-center) is a 13-acre greenhouse, nursery, and research site part of the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation. Collaborating with greenhouse staff allowed me to conduct an experiment on ecosystem services from green roofs in 2016.
